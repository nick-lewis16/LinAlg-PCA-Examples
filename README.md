# LinAlg-PCA-Examples

In this project, I do 3 different examples utilizing concepts from linear algebra and principal component analysis.

1. Solving a linear system.
2. Stochastic matrix representing transitions of a Markov chain modeling the stock market.
3. Singular Value Decomposition example from dataset.
